# Can be used with the plots but specifying the path is very important which is
# generally not allowed from default through RStudio

# Very amazing plots can be given by facet trelliscope 
# similar can be done by ggplot facet but trelliscope preffered over it. 
# As the execution takes some time so better to restrict to the rows and columns 
# and don't use for big data application on the local machine.
